Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      database server (mysql) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the mysql process 'database server' with the
      command 'systemctl restart mysql '

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart mysql failed
        with error: Job for mysql.service failed because the control
        process exited with error code. See "systemctl status
        mysql.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        database server (mysql)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check removed enough files to increase partition
      "/" freespace to 10%.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 83 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 83 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab1 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab1 down" and then "ifconfig lab1 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab1.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab1 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
       7557       /usr/bin/python    master   100.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 1 separate ethernet
    interfaces is not running. Check the network switch - it is
    probably turned off.

 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was -163 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was -163 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was -17 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was -17 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
      28750              tuxpaint  student6   100.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

      16055  /opt/libreoffice6.4/program/soffice.bin  student6   89.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
       2790  /opt/libreoffice6.4/program/soffice.bin  student6   95.6%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 78 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 78 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the

    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      Kahn Academy server (ka-lite) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the ka-lite process 'Kahn Academy server'
      with the command 'systemctl restart ka-lite'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart ka-lite failed
        with error: Job for ka-lite.service failed because the control
        process exited with error code. See "systemctl status ka-
        lite.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        Kahn Academy server (ka-lite)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      Kahn Academy server (ka-lite) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the ka-lite process 'Kahn Academy server'
      with the command 'systemctl restart ka-lite'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart ka-lite failed
        with error: Job for ka-lite.service failed because the control
        process exited with error code. See "systemctl status ka-
        lite.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        Kahn Academy server (ka-lite)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server

        of the System Check window

 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is not running. Check the network switch - it is
    probably turned off.

 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

       7422  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student6   86.6%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

        that could cause the internet to fail. Will retry internet
        connection one more time to see if the the internet will work
        now.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
      23887  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student+   88.8%
      24893  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student+   97.7%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high memory usage problem process is probably bad. Unless you do
    recognize it and know that it should use so much memory or if the
    memory usage is above 50% stop the process. To stop, use the ID
    from the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check
    once more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill
    -9 ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The internet interface is running
    but does not have its automatically assigned ip address.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig internet down" and then "ifconfig internet up". This
      will take a little time.
 Fix result: The network interface internet is now working correctly.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

Will attempt to fix this problem- There is a problem with the way the
    server finds network addresses.
 Starting fix: Restarting the bind9 process 'internet name server'
      with the command 'systemctl restart bind9 '

Problem> Some fixes have been performed after repairing some problems
        that could cause the internet to fail. Will retry internet
        connection one more time to see if the the internet will work
        now.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface internet has not
    started successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig internet down" and then "ifconfig internet up". This
      will take a little time.
 Fix result: The network interface internet is now working correctly.

Problem> The test ping to the internet router failed. The server
        interface and the router interface are OK. There must be a
        problem inside the router.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Turn the power to the internet modem off and back on and reboot it.
    Check the lights as it starts to be sure that it ethernet
    interface starts up and blinks. After it is fully started run
    System Check again.

      13469  /usr/games/gcompris-gnuchess  student+   102.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if

 Starting fix: Restarting the bind9 process 'internet name server'
      with the command 'systemctl restart bind9 '

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      system load monitor server (system-monitor) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-monitor process 'system load
      monitor server' with the command 'systemctl restart system-
      monitor'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart system-monitor
        failed with error: Job for system-monitor.service failed
        because the control process exited with error code. See
        "systemctl status system-monitor.service" and "journalctl -xe"
        for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.
- Number of computers on the local network: 8 

Will attempt to fix this problem- There is a problem with the way the
    server finds network addresses.
 Starting fix: Restarting the bind9 process 'internet name server'
      with the command 'systemctl restart bind9 '

Problem> Some fixes have been performed after repairing some problems
        that could cause the internet to fail. Will retry internet
        connection one more time to see if the the internet will work
        now.

Problem> Some fixes have been performed after repairing some problems
        that could cause the internet to fail. Will retry internet
        connection one more time to see if the the internet will work
        now.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> Some fixes have been performed after repairing some problems
        that could cause the internet to fail. Will retry internet
        connection one more time to see if the the internet will work
        now.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 93% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Starting fix: Even after removing safe files there was not enough
      free space on the "/" partition. System Check will now remove
      some of the higher numbered student accounts' home directories.
        - 0 student home directories were removed. The highest number 
        student account is now student40. No student accounts with a higher 
        number than this can be used.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      system load monitor server (system-monitor) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-monitor process 'system load
      monitor server' with the command 'systemctl restart system-
      monitor'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart system-monitor
        failed with error: Job for system-monitor.service failed
        because the control process exited with error code. See
        "systemctl status system-monitor.service" and "journalctl -xe"
        for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 165 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 165 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 165 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 165 days ago.

Will attempt to fix this problem- There is a problem with the way the
    server finds network addresses.
 Starting fix: Restarting the bind9 process 'internet name server'
      with the command 'systemctl restart bind9 '

Problem> Some fixes have been performed after repairing some problems
        that could cause the internet to fail. Will retry internet
        connection one more time to see if the the internet will work
        now.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 170 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 170 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 170 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 170 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 93% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Starting fix: Even after removing safe files there was not enough
      free space on the "/" partition. System Check will now remove
      some of the higher numbered student accounts' home directories.
        - 0 student home directories were removed. The highest number 
        student account is now student40. No student accounts with a higher 
        number than this can be used.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

Will attempt to fix this problem- There is a problem with the way the
    server finds network addresses.
 Starting fix: Restarting the bind9 process 'internet name server'

Problem> Some fixes have been performed after repairing some problems
        that could cause the internet to fail. Will retry internet
        connection one more time to see if the the internet will work
        now.

 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more

    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server
        to the internet is bad. Note: If you do not have internet and
        you always see this message then edit the /etc/System
        Check.conf file and change internet_available to False. You
        can also uncheck the Internet Avaiable box in the upper left
        of the System Check window

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

        can also uncheck the Internet Avaiable box in the upper left

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server

        you always see this message then edit the /etc/System

        can also uncheck the Internet Avaiable box in the upper left
        of the System Check window

       8779  /opt/libreoffice6.4/program/soffice.bin  sysadmin   99.8%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

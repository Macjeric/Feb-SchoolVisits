Problem> The backup log could not be found or it was empty.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is not running. Check the network switch - it is

Will attempt to fix this problem- The internet interface is running
    but does not have its automatically assigned ip address.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig internet down" and then "ifconfig internet up". This
      will take a little time.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is not running. Check the network switch - it is

 Try restarting the internet modem and then run System Check again
    after the modem is finished booting. If this still does not work
    check the light on the modem for the connection to the internet
    after the modem restarts. The modem itself may be bad or not
    configured correctly. Check the manual for your modem further
    information. The internet will not work until this problem is
    corrected.

    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's

      13161  /usr/local/share/idea/jre64/bin/java  student2   109.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 5 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 3 days ago. The last backup of the student directories

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check removed enough files to increase partition
      "/" freespace to 8%.

 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands

      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab1.

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      network file system (nfs-kernel-server) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file

 Fix result: All required processes now running. This may fix your
      problem. Please run System Check again to check if all problems

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab1 has not started

 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab1 down" and then "ifconfig lab1 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab1.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
        672  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student+   94.6%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 4 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 4 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab1 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab1 down" and then "ifconfig lab1 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab1.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

       7387  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student+   85.3%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 7 days

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 94% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Starting fix: Even after removing safe files there was not enough
      free space on the "/" partition. System Check will now remove
      some of the higher numbered student accounts' home directories.
        - 0 student home directories were removed. The highest number 
        student account is now student40. No student accounts with a higher 
        number than this can be used.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of
    the text.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 98% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Starting fix: Even after removing safe files there was not enough
      free space on the "/" partition. System Check will now remove
      some of the higher numbered student accounts' home directories.
        - 5 student home directories were removed. The highest number 
        student account is now student30. No student accounts with a higher 
        number than this can be used.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of
    the text.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
      22196  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student2   110.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
       4633  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student9   97.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the

 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 6 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 6 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 98% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 9 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 9 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of
    the text.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 18 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 18 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 99% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 20 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 20 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 96% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of
    the text.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 22 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 22 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 93% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of
    the text.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 24 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 24 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 97% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of
    the text.

        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 29 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 99% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of
    the text.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 99% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to rpeort a later problem.
 Fix result: System Check failed to create enough free space in the
      "/" partion.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command is in the photo. You may need to
    make the terminal window bigger before yo do this to show all of

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If

    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from

    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need
    to make the terminal window bigger before you do this to show all
    of the text.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 47 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was yesterday. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was yesterday. The last backup of the
        entire system was 47 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 97% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need
    to make the terminal window bigger before you do this to show all
    of the text.

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      network file system server (nfs-kernel-server) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file
      system server' with the command 'systemctl restart nfs-kernel-
      server '
 Fix result: All required processes now running. This may fix your
      problem. Please run System Check again to check if all problems
      are solved.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 51 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was yesterday. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was yesterday. The last backup of the
        entire system was 51 days ago.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 98% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need
    to make the terminal window bigger before you do this to show all
    of the text.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 96% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the

    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need

Problem> The system partition "/" is 93% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need
    to make the terminal window bigger before you do this to show all

Problem> The system partition "/" is 93% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need
    to make the terminal window bigger before you do this to show all
    of the text.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab2 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab2 down" and then "ifconfig lab2 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab2.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab2 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab2 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab2 down" and then "ifconfig lab2 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab2.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab2 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 96% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that

    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart mysql failed
        with error: Job for mysql.service failed because the control
        process exited with error code. See "systemctl status
        mysql.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file
      system server' with the command 'systemctl restart nfs-kernel-
      server '

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        database server (mysql)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If

        with error: Job for mysql.service failed because the control
        process exited with error code. See "systemctl status

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      network file system server (nfs-kernel-server) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file
      system server' with the command 'systemctl restart nfs-kernel-
      server '
 Fix result: All required processes now running. This may fix your
      problem. Please run System Check again to check if all problems
      are solved.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab2 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab2 down" and then "ifconfig lab2 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab2.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab2 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab1 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab1 down" and then "ifconfig lab1 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab1.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab1 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need
    to make the terminal window bigger before you do this to show all
    of the text.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
       1206  /opt/libreoffice6.4/program/soffice.bin  student+   110.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Will attempt to fix this problem- These required system processes have stopped:
      database server (mysql)
      Kahn Academy server (ka-lite)
      system load monitor server (system-monitor)
      network file system server (nfs-kernel-server)
 Will now restart them.
 Starting fix: Restarting the mysql process 'database server' with the
      command 'systemctl restart mysql '
 Starting fix: Restarting the ka-lite process 'Kahn Academy server'
      with the command 'systemctl restart ka-lite'
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-monitor process 'system load
      monitor server' with the command 'systemctl restart system-
      monitor'
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file
      system server' with the command 'systemctl restart nfs-kernel-
      server '
 Fix result: All required processes now running. This may fix your
      problem. Please run System Check again to check if all problems
      are solved.

    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once

Will attempt to fix this problem- These required system processes have stopped:
      system performance monitor server (system-performance-monitor)
      system load monitor server (system-monitor)
      rebuild student homes server (monitor-inactive)
 Will now restart them.
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-performance-monitor process
      'system performance monitor server' with the command 'systemctl
      restart system-performance-monitor'
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-monitor process 'system load
      monitor server' with the command 'systemctl restart system-
      monitor'
 Starting fix: Restarting the monitor-inactive process 'rebuild
      student homes server' with the command 'systemctl restart
      replace-inactive '

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart replace-
        inactive failed with error: Failed to restart replace-
        inactive.service: Unit replace-inactive.service not found.
 Fix result: All required processes now running. This may fix your
      problem. Please run System Check again to check if all problems
      are solved.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was unknown.
        The last backup of the home directories "/client_home" was
        today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 30.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is not running. Check the network switch - it is
    probably turned off.

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      network file system server (nfs-kernel-server) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file
      system server' with the command 'systemctl restart nfs-kernel-
      server '
 Fix result: All required processes now running. This may fix your
      problem. Please run System Check again to check if all problems
      are solved.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is working but the ethernet interface lab1 is not
    running. The cable is probably disconnected or it is bad. Check
    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab1" and then "ifup lab1". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Starting fix: Even after removing safe files there was not enough
      free space on the "/" partition. System Check will now remove
      some of the higher numbered student accounts' home directories.
        - 5 student home directories were removed. The highest number 
        student account is now student30. No student accounts with a higher 
        number than this can be used.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      network file system server (nfs-kernel-server) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file
      system server' with the command 'systemctl restart nfs-kernel-
      server '
 Fix result: All required processes now running. This may fix your
      problem. Please run System Check again to check if all problems
      are solved.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab1 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab1 down" and then "ifconfig lab1 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab1.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab1 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 99% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need
    to make the terminal window bigger before you do this to show all
    of the text.

 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the

Problem> The system partition "/" is 100% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab1 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab1 down" and then "ifconfig lab1 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab1.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

      24648                x11vnc  student4   96.9%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning

    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      system load monitor server (system-monitor) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-monitor process 'system load
      monitor server' with the command 'systemctl restart system-
      monitor'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart system-monitor
        failed with error: Job for system-monitor.service failed
        because the control process exited with error code. See
        "systemctl status system-monitor.service" and "journalctl -xe"
        for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 105 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 105 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 105 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 105 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the

      system load monitor server (system-monitor) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-monitor process 'system load
      monitor server' with the command 'systemctl restart system-
      monitor'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart system-monitor
        failed with error: Job for system-monitor.service failed
        because the control process exited with error code. See
        "systemctl status system-monitor.service" and "journalctl -xe"
        for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 129 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 129 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 129 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 129 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The system partition "/" is 98% full.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The system partition is so full that
    System Check must try to remove some files. This should not affect
    the system, but remember to report this has been done if you have
    wish to report a later problem.
 Starting fix: Even after removing safe files there was not enough
      free space on the "/" partition. System Check will now remove
      some of the higher numbered student accounts' home directories.
        - 5 student home directories were removed. The highest number 
        student account is now student30. No student accounts with a higher 
        number than this can be used.
 Fix result: Invalid message id: 'root partition still too full'. This
      is a program error and not the actual message. Please report
      this to the Superuser group.

 The "/" directory is still too full for safe use. Please run the
    command "sudo du -sh /*" in a terminal and email the result
    rene@gmail.com. If you send a photo of the terminal make sure that
    ALL of the results of the command are in the photo. You may need
    to make the terminal window bigger before you do this to show all
    of the text.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 7 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 7 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 7 days ago. The last backup of the
        entire system was 7 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
      11328  /usr/lib/firefox/firefox  student+   102.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 3 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 3 days ago. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

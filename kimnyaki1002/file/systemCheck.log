Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was unknown.
        The last backup of the home directories "/client_home" was
        unknown. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was unknown. The last backup of the
        entire system was 30.

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server
        to the internet is bad. Note: If you do not have internet and
        you always see this message then edit the /etc/System
        Check.conf file and change internet_available to False. You
        can also uncheck the Internet Avaiable box in the upper left
        of the System Check window

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is not running. Check the network switch - it is
    probably turned off.

 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is working but the ethernet interface lab2 is not
    running. The cable is probably disconnected or it is bad. Check
    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab2" and then "ifup lab2". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on
    the network switch may be bad.

 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab2 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab2 down" and then "ifconfig lab2 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab2.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab2 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card? If so, see the
        System Administrator's Manual for more information. If not,
        try rebooting the computer. If you are still not successful
        then the interface hardware may have failed.

Will attempt to fix this problem- There is a problem with the way the
    server finds network addresses.
 Starting fix: Restarting the bind9 process 'name server' with the
      command 'systemctl restart bind9 '

Problem> Some fixes have been performed after repairing some problems
        that could cause the internet to fail. Will retry internet
        connection one more time to see if the the internet will work
        now.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
      30792          /usr/bin/vlc  teacher+   155.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was today.
        The last backup of the home directories "/client_home" was 4
        days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 4 days ago.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
      16509          /usr/bin/vlc  sysadmin   103.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands

        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab2 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab2 down" and then "ifconfig lab2 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab2.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab2 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card? If so, see the
        System Administrator's Manual for more information. If not,
        try rebooting the computer. If you are still not successful
        then the interface hardware may have failed.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface internet has not
    started successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig internet down" and then "ifconfig internet up". This
      will take a little time.
 Fix result: The network interface internet has been partially fixed.
      It is running but still has no ip address.

Problem> The test ping to the internet router failed. The server
        interface and the router interface are OK. There must be a
        problem inside the router.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Try restarting the internet modem and then run System Check again
    after the modem is finished booting. If this still does not work
    check the light on the modem for the connection to the internet
    after the modem restarts. The modem itself may be bad or not
    configured correctly. Check the manual for your modem further
    information. The internet will not work until this problem is
    corrected.

 Turn the power to the internet modem off and back on and reboot it.
    Check the lights as it starts to be sure that it ethernet
    interface starts up and blinks. After it is fully started run
    System Check again.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is working but the ethernet interface lab1 is not
    running. The cable is probably disconnected or it is bad. Check
    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab1" and then "ifup lab1". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on
    the network switch may be bad.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.
-- 1 problem found. 0 problems fixed, 0 problems need action.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 4 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was yesterday. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was yesterday. The last backup of the
        entire system was 4 days ago.

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server
        to the internet is bad. Note: If you do not have internet and
        you always see this message then edit the /etc/System
        Check.conf file and change internet_available to False. You
        can also uncheck the Internet Avaiable box in the upper left
        of the System Check window

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

        entire system was 7 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

        ID            Name            User       %Use
      25236              tuxpaint  student+   101.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.
-- 1 problem found. 0 problems fixed, 0 problems need action.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

        The last backup of the home directories "/client_home" was 3
        days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab1 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab1 down" and then "ifconfig lab1 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab1.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab1 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> Some processes are using too much CPU:

       9481  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student5   108.0%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The sysadmin home directory has 3866 MB. Please remove larger files
    such as videos that you may have stored in this directory, then
    rerun SystemCheck to see if enough space is available. The
    sysadmin account should be used >>only<< for direct system
    administration work. No files for any other purpose should be
    stored in this account.

      24942  /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin  student5   97.2%


***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The high CPU usage problem process might just be temporary. Wait for
    two minutes then run System Check again. If the same process is a
    problem check the problem process's name. If the name is openshot,
    pencil, or blender then it may be doing a long running task and is
    ok. If the program is firefox then probably phet is running a
    simulation. Check which users are running a phet simulation and
    ask them to stop. If there is another program using 100% cpu it
    may have failed and is stuck running. Check the problem process's
    user and consider stopping the process. To stop, use the ID from
    the table in the command "sudo kill ID". Run System Check once
    more. If the same process is still a problem type "sudo kill -9
    ID". Check the manual or Reneal Superusers Group for futher
    information.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab2 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab2 down" and then "ifconfig lab2 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab2.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab2 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server
        to the internet is bad. Note: If you do not have internet and
        you always see this message then edit the /etc/System
        Check.conf file and change internet_available to False. You
        can also uncheck the Internet Avaiable box in the upper left
        of the System Check window

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

        for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

        "/client_home_students" was 83 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 84 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab2 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab2 down" and then "ifconfig lab2 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab2.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab2 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If

        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Will attempt to fix this problem- These required system processes have stopped:
      network file system server (nfs-kernel-server)
      system load monitor server (system-monitor)
 Will now restart them.
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Will attempt to fix this problem- These required system processes have stopped:
      system load monitor server (system-monitor)
      network file system server (nfs-kernel-server)
 Will now restart them.
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-monitor process 'system load
      monitor server' with the command 'systemctl restart system-
      monitor'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart system-monitor
        failed with error: Job for system-monitor.service failed
        because the control process exited with error code. See
        "systemctl status system-monitor.service" and "journalctl -xe"
        for details.
 Starting fix: Restarting the nfs-kernel-server process 'network file
      system server' with the command 'systemctl restart nfs-kernel-
      server '

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.
- Internet quality: Fair
- Number of computers on the local network: 1 

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 107 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 106 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 106 days ago. The last backup of
        the entire system was 107 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      system load monitor server (system-monitor) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the system-monitor process 'system load
      monitor server' with the command 'systemctl restart system-
      monitor'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart system-monitor
        failed with error: Job for system-monitor.service failed
        because the control process exited with error code. See
        "systemctl status system-monitor.service" and "journalctl -xe"
        for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if

            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        system load monitor server (system-monitor)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface internet has not
    started successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig internet down" and then "ifconfig internet up". This
      will take a little time.
 Fix result: The network interface internet is now working correctly.

Problem> The test ping to the internet router failed. The server
        interface and the router interface are OK. There must be a
        problem inside the router.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Turn the power to the internet modem off and back on and reboot it.
    Check the lights as it starts to be sure that it ethernet
    interface starts up and blinks. After it is fully started run
    System Check again.

Serious Problem>>> The interface lab1 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface internet has not
    started successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig internet down" and then "ifconfig internet up". This
      will take a little time.
 Fix result: The network interface internet is now working correctly.

Problem> The test ping to the internet router failed. The server
        interface and the router interface are OK. There must be a
        problem inside the router.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 Turn the power to the internet modem off and back on and reboot it.
    Check the lights as it starts to be sure that it ethernet
    interface starts up and blinks. After it is fully started run
    System Check again.

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server
        to the internet is bad. Note: If you do not have internet and
        you always see this message then edit the /etc/System
        Check.conf file and change internet_available to False. You
        can also uncheck the Internet Avaiable box in the upper left
        of the System Check window

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface internet has not
    started successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig internet down" and then "ifconfig internet up". This
      will take a little time.
 Fix result: The network interface internet is now working correctly.

Problem> The test ping to the internet router failed. The server
        interface and the router interface are OK. There must be a
        problem inside the router.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Turn the power to the internet modem off and back on and reboot it.
    Check the lights as it starts to be sure that it ethernet
    interface starts up and blinks. After it is fully started run
    System Check again.

-- 3 problems found. 1 problem fixed, 1 problem needs action.

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server
        to the internet is bad. Note: If you do not have internet and
        you always see this message then edit the /etc/System
        Check.conf file and change internet_available to False. You
        can also uncheck the Internet Avaiable box in the upper left
        of the System Check window

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the internet modem. Unplug and then fully plug in the cable
    on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have a bad
    cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 4 days

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Will attempt to fix this problem- The internet interface is running
    but does not have its automatically assigned ip address.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig internet down" and then "ifconfig internet up". This
      will take a little time.
 Fix result: The network interface internet is now working correctly.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

- Internet quality: Very Poor / Unusable

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was today.
        The last backup of the home directories "/client_home" was 4
        days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 5 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if

        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other

Will attempt to fix this problem- The interface lab2 has not started
    successfully and is not up.
 Starting fix: I will try to restart the interface with the commands
      "ifconfig lab2 down" and then "ifconfig lab2 up". This will take
      a little time.
 Fix result: This did not fix the problem with lab2.

<<<< >>>>
Serious Problem>>> The interface lab2 could not be started. Have you
        just removed or replaced the ethernet card or, if wireless,
        the wireless USB? If so, see the System Administrator's Manual
        for more information. If not, try rebooting the computer. If
        you are still not successful then the interface hardware may
        have failed.

Problem> The internet is down but there is no problem in the server.
        Your internet service from outside may be down or the internet
        router might not be working. Turn the internet router off and
        then back on. Watch the lights as it starts to see if it
        starts correctly and shows a connection to the outside
        internet link. If it does not show the connection then your
        service has failed. Wait a while to see if it returns and if
        necessary report the problem to your internet service
        provider. Read the manual for your internet router for other
        information.

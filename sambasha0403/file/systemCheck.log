Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      firewall / router (shorewall) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the shorewall process 'firewall / router'
      with the command 'systemctl restart shorewall '

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart shorewall
        failed with error: Job for shorewall.service failed because
        the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl
        status shorewall.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        firewall / router (shorewall)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was unknown.
        The last backup of the home directories "/client_home" was
        today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 30.

Problem> The test ping to the internet router failed. The server
        interface and the router interface are OK. There must be a
        problem inside the router.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is not running. Check the network switch - it is
    probably turned off.

 Interface internet is not running. Check for lights on the interface
    and on the ethernet switch. Unplug and then fully plug in the
    cable on both ends. If this does not fix the problem you may have
    a bad cable or bad interface. Try replacing the cable and retest.

 Turn the power to the internet modem off and back on and reboot it.
    Check the lights as it starts to be sure that it ethernet
    interface starts up and blinks. After it is fully started run
    System Check again.

Problem> The internet is down. The network connection from the server
        to the internet is bad. Note: If you do not have internet and
        you always see this message then edit the /etc/System

Will attempt to fix this problem- This required system process has stopped:
      Kahn Academy server (ka-lite) Will now restart it.
 Starting fix: Restarting the ka-lite process 'Kahn Academy server'
      with the command 'systemctl restart ka-lite'

Problem> This process could not be restarted successfully. This was
        the reported error: --Command systemctl restart ka-lite failed
        with error: Job for ka-lite.service failed because the control
        process exited with error code. See "systemctl status ka-
        lite.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

Problem> This required system process was not successfully restarted or 
          failed again just after restart: 
        Kahn Academy server (ka-lite)

Problem> The failure to restart the process means that other 
            problems that are caused by this failure may appear in the other tests.
            You should try restarting the server and then rerunning
            System Check. If the problem remains then analyze any error
            reports and possibly log files for further ideas.
- Number of computers on the local network: 2 

Will attempt to fix this problem- The server for Kahn Academy is not
    running correctly. Will try server restart.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The Kahn Acadmy server is still not working correctly. Try restarting
    yourself with the commands: "sudo systemctl stop ka-lite" "sudo
    service start ka-lite" Check the messages at the end of
    /var/log/syslog.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is working but the ethernet interface lab2 is not
    running. The cable is probably disconnected or it is bad. Check
    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab2" and then "ifup lab2". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on
    the network switch may be bad.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is working but the ethernet interface lab2 is not
    running. The cable is probably disconnected or it is bad. Check
    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab2" and then "ifup lab2". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on
    the network switch may be bad.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 4 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 4 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 4 days ago. The last backup of the
        entire system was 4 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is working but the ethernet interface lab2 is not
    running. The cable is probably disconnected or it is bad. Check
    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab2" and then "ifup lab2". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on
    the network switch may be bad.

 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is working but the ethernet interface lab2 is not
    running. The cable is probably disconnected or it is bad. Check
    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab2" and then "ifup lab2". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on
    the network switch may be bad.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was 3 days ago. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was 3 days ago. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

Problem> The last backup of the primary OS filesystem "/" was 3 days
        ago. The last backup of the home directories "/client_home"
        was today. The last backup of the student directories
        "/client_home_students" was today. The last backup of the
        entire system was 3 days ago.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 If you have just booted the server then it might be running the
    backup right now. Wait 15 minutes and run System Check again. If
    this message still appears or if the server has run 20 or more
    minutes already today then run the system backup now with the
    command "sudo backupAllFilesystems.py". The backup may run for
    many minutes and could slightly slow down your users.

***** Do this next and then rerun System Check ******
 The bonded network connection bond0 which uses 2 separate ethernet
    interfaces is working but the ethernet interface lab1 is not
    running. The cable is probably disconnected or it is bad. Check
    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab1" and then "ifup lab1". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on
    the network switch may be bad.

    the lights on the interfaces and the switch to determine which
    ethernet interface has the problem and then unplug and replug the
    connector on both the server and the switch. If that does not work
    then try the command "ifdown lab1" and then "ifup lab1". If that
    does not work then the interface card in the server or the port on
    the network switch may be bad.
